# Finite-state-lab

### Intro:

This finite state lab is a simple state change, with the use of HTML5 incorporating buttons that allow the user to switch to another screen. I implemented css styling to make it more visually appealing for the user and myself. 

---

### Framework:

With using HTML and CSS with an attempt at JS which was not as successful as I hoped. Within the HTML files I used div tags to seperate my paragraph tags and my buttons to allow me to create spacing between them. CSS portion of the code represents the different states when a button is pressed through out the game.

### Nodes/Mechanism

Each node is represented by a separate HTML file. Each of these HTML files have a CSS styling sheet linked to them. Navigation/Mechanism between the nodes is through each button which is in an "a" tag which defines hyperlinks.

### Reflection 

When creating this homework assingment I learned the importance of creating a outline of what I want the project to contain. Within CSS I gained more skills in this area which will allow myself to use those skills in other projects moving foward.

### Proud of/Things I'd like to get to  

I am proud of the look of the assingment, I felt as if the glass back ground added great visual appeal to the HTML5. I would like to get to Javascript and implmenting it into the course.
